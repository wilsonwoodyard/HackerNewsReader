# HackerNewsReader
This was built during my bootcamp using SwiftUI, WebKit and an API from Hacker News.

This was programmed from scratch with SwiftUI. I was able to initialize a listView with the most recent hits from the Hacker News website and then display that on a separate DetailView that utilizes the WebView framwork to embed the news article into the view.
